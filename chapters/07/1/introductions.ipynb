However, the underlying mechanisms—such as yeast fermentation, gluten development, and heat transfer—are complex, and their full intricacies may not be immediately apparent. To navigate and comprehend these complexities, scientists and engineers employ **models** to distill the world's workings into manageable and understandable segments.\n",

For instance, if we want to create a baseline model from a dataset of houses with an average price of $500,000, the baseline model would predict $500,000 for every new house it encounters. Regardless of the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, or location, this baseline model will always predict the same value. \n",
