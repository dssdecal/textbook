    "# Section: Comparison Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In any programming language, including Python, comparison operators are crucial for making decisions and evaluating conditions. They allow you to compare two values and determine the relationship between them, such as whether one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. The result of a comparison is always a boolean value: either `True` or `False`. This makes comparison operators particularly useful in control flow statements like `if`, `while`, and `for` loops, where decisions are made based on specific conditions."
